This directory contains POSTMAN collection for using F5's Declarative Onboarding (DO) and Application Services v3 (AS3) declarations to add configuration either via BIG-IP or BIG-IQ (look at name of file for which one).  If it is a BIG-IQ file, make sure to adjust the name of the BIG-IP referenced in the declararion for it to run smootly.

More details coming soon.
